%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 3 | Part 1: One-vs-all

%  Instructions
%  ------------
%
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions
%  in this exericse:
%
%     lrCostFunction.m (logistic regression cost function)
%     oneVsAll.m
%     predictOneVsAll.m
%     predict.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
%

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% Setup the parameters you will use for this part of the exercise
input_layer_size  = 400;  % 20x20 Input Images of Digits
num_labels = 10;          % 10 labels, from 1 to 10
                          % (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

%% =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset.
%  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
%

% Load Training Data
fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

load('ex3data1.mat'); % training data stored in arrays X, y
size(X)
size(y)
y=y'
y(0:20)
